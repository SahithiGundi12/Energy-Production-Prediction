# Energy-Production-Prediction
Constructed a regression model to predict energy production, facilitating  informed decision-making for customers
Conducted EDA, data cleaning, and preprocessing using pandas, Sklearn,
 Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Numpy. Employed regression algorithms such as
 RandomForest, XGBoost, DecisionTree, and LogisticRegression to develop predictive
 models.
 Empowered customers to forecast energy production based on input
 parameters, enhancing operational efficiency.
